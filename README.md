**News Sentiment Analysis Project**
*Project Description*
This project implements two advanced sentiment analysis models for classifying news articles as either positive or negative. The project showcases the application of cutting-edge natural language processing techniques, deep learning architectures, and transfer learning to achieve high-accuracy sentiment prediction.

*Key Components:*

Custom Neural Network Model:
* Utilizes a sophisticated architecture combining convolutional layers, bidirectional LSTM layers, and attention mechanisms.
* Designed to capture both local and long-range dependencies in text data.
* Incorporates advanced techniques like multi-head attention and regularization for improved performance.

BERT-based Model:
* Leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art language model.
* Employs transfer learning to benefit from BERT's pre-trained knowledge of language structure and context.
* Fine-tuned for the specific task of news sentiment classification.

Both models utilize sophisticated text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords and punctuation, to enhance the quality of input data.
